A smart conveyor-belt with AWS DeepLens and IoT

The Industrial IoT demo is a comprehensive demo that combines several AWS technologies to show the art of the possible in how AWS can play a central role in industrial design & automation, fleet management, predictive maintenance, and technician training. It features a 3D printed conveyor belt that is connected to AWS IoT.

This repository contains lab instruction to build a demo in your class to that will leverage AWS DeepLens camera to simulate communicate with the AWS IoT device shadow, control a virtual conveyor's stepper motor, and publish telemetry data.

There will be a physical version of this lab running on an actual conveyor-belt to showcase the interaction between the DeepLens camera, conveyor-bet device and IoT Cloud.
